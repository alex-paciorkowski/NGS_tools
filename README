A collection of perlscripts useful for analysis of NGS (specifically whole exome sequencing) data.
The workflow in general looks like this:
Raw fastq files are aligned with BWA.
SNVs are called using GATK.
Indels are called using GATK or Pindel.
SNV and indel VCFs are then filtered by pedigree (suspected AD or AR) and GQ score using the appropriate finder.pl script.
The output VCFs are then annotated using either SeattleSeq or Annovar.
The resulting annotated VCFs are then parsed using Solve.pm (under development).
This module identifies unique gene symbols and annotates them further, allowing for rapid automated review of candidate genes.
